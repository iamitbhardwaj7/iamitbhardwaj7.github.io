			<p>Android Studio is the official  integrated development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems.It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools (ADT) as the primary IDE for native Android application development.
Android Studio was announced on May 16, 2013 at the Google I/O conference. It was in early access preview stage starting from version 0.1 in May 2013, then entered beta stage starting from version 0.8 which was released in June 2014.The first stable build was released in December 2014, starting from version 1.0.
Since 7 May 2019, Kotlin is Googleâ€™s preferred language for Android app development.Still, other languages are supported, including by Android Studio.

			<p>Android studio contains all the Android sDK tools to design, test, debug and profile your app. By looking at the development tools and environment, we can its similar to eclispe with the ADT plug-in but as I have mentioned above its android focused IDE, there are many cool features available in Android Studio which can foster and increase your development productivity.
One great thing is that it depends on the IntelliJ Idea IDE which is proved itself a great IDE and has been using by most all the Android engineers.On top of the capabilities you expect from IntelliJ, Android Studio offers:
</p>
			<p>i)Flexible Gradle-based build system.</p>
            <p>ii)Code templates to help you build common app features.</p>
            <p>iii)Rich layout editor with support for drag and drop theme editing.</p>
            <p>iv)Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility, and other problems.</p>
            <p>v)ProGuard and app-signing capabilities.</p>
            <p>vi)Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, making it easy to integrate Google Cloud Messaging and App Engine And much more.</p>	
            <p>For some years now it's been clear that Android is a force to be reckoned with in the mobile OS landscape. This Java-based technology has sparked a new gold rush, with programmers competing to make money from their mobile apps. Android jobs are also plentiful.
To be successful, Android developers need a good grasp of the Java language (or Kotlin), Android APIs, and Android application architecture. It's also important to use an appropriate and effective development environment. For many years, Eclipse IDE with the ADT plugin was the preferred platform for Android development. Today, it's Android Studio.
